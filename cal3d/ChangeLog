  - The header files of Cal3D are now installed to '/usr/local/include/cal3d'
    when executing the 'make install' command. (Thanks to Brandon Ehle!)
  - The skeleton pose is now set to the initial state when no active animation
    exists. (Thanks to Brandon Ehle!)
  - Enhanced the CalVector and CalQuaternion class with a great number of
    operators. (Thanks to Wolfgang Scheicher!)
  - CalVector is now used as type of the vertex position and normal data in
    the CalCoreSubmesh and CalSubmesh class.
  - Revamped the animation pipeline: Added a CalPhysique helper class and a
    CalSpringSystem class.
  - Experimental cloth animation system implemented in the CalSpringSystem
    class. (Thanks to Wolfgang Scheicher!)
  - Changed the whole bone influence system to a localized bone transformation
    approach. This was needed for the planned cloth animation system and for a
    better vertex shader support.
  - Moved the 'weight' member variable and its accessor from the derived
    classes to the CalAnimation class.
  - Removed the unused 'duration' argument from the CalLoader::loadCoreTrack()
    and CalSaver::saveCoreTrack() functions.
  - Moved the setMaterialSet() function from the CalModel class to the
    CalRenderer class.
  - Relicensed the library under the LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License).
  - CalCoreSkeleton::addCoreBone() inserts root core bones automatically into
    the root core bone list now. The function addRootCoreBoneId() was removed.

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  - Fixed the bone/vertex/normal transformation pipeline. There was a bug in
    the library and another in the exporter. Together they worked pretty much
    correct, but there were those weird normals in some of the models.
  - Added a user-data member variable and accessors to the CalCoreBone,
    CalCoreMaterial, CalCoreModel and CalModel classes.
  - Finished the LOD handling in the CalRenderer, CalMesh and CalCoreMesh
    classes.
  - Implemented the whole material system with material-sets and -threads.
  - I decided to implement a material class (CalCoreMaterial) and a new file
    type for it (.crf). This should lead to a very flexible material handling.
    (such as swapping materials on the fly on submeshes etc.).
  - Texture coordinates are stored differently in the CalCoreSubmesh class to
    optimize access from the CalRenderer interface.
  - A new class CalRenderer was added that serves as a clean interface for
    the external rendering loop.
  - Fixed all *.cpp files to include config.h if HAVE_CONFIG_H is set.
  - Converted CalModel::getMeshVertices() and CalModel::getMeshNormals() to
    CalModel::getSubmeshVertices() and CalModel::getSubmeshNormals().
  - Created a little model viewer named 'MiniViewer' that can be run from the
    command-line.
  - Complete redesign of the mesh handling. It is now much cleaner and ready
    for LOD (level of detail).
  - Changed the fileformats to include a version info field. Furthermore, the
    magic file cookies were modified to reflect the incompatibility to the
    old fileformat.
  - Fixed a bug in the calculation of the blending factor between two
    keyframes that caused a visible crack in the animation.
  - Added a few accessor functions that are used by the exporter framework.
  - Polished the error class and its error messages a bit.

| Version 0.5 (5. May 2001)                                                   |
o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  - Added the CalSaver class which can be used to save skeleton, animation
    and mesh files. This is useful for writing export plugins and storing
    generic created data for later use.
  - Redesign of the core mesh class. It supports different materiels and
    submeshes now. Unlimited (texture-)map channels are possible.
  - 3d Studio Max exporter handles materials and maps.
  - Implemented the second animation type (named 'action').
  - Reorganized the project directory and the workspaces of kdevelop and msvc..
  - Created a little demo (called 'The Cally Demo') based on cal3d and OpenGL.
  - Optimized the keyframe lookup and other STL performance issues.
  - Mesh handling implemented. Vertices and normals are influenced by one or
    more weighted bone states.
  - Switched to simple binary file-formats. This gives a shorter loading time
    and cal3d does not depend on another library.
  - A first 3d Studio Max exporter plugin is born. It can export biped
    animations and colored/textured meshes. It is not very stable though =)
  - Created a first version of an exporter-plugin for Milkshape 3D. This makes
    it a lot easier to get animation files for testing =)
  - Added linear blending between 2 keyframes, this gives smoother animations.
  - Implemented the core animation-track-keyframe structure and extended the
    XML loader to load it.
  - Added the CalMixer class that handles all the animation blending
  - The first type of animation (named 'cycles') is available.
  - Extended the CalVector and CalQuaternion classes with blending functions.
  - A quick-and-dirty test-frontend was added (based on SDL and OpenGL) to see
    the animations on screen.
  - Implemented the core model-skeleton-bone structure and a XML loader for
    it (based on libxml2).
  - The model-skeleton-bone structure that is cloned from the core versions
    for every instance of a specific model was coded.
  - An error handling mechanism is in place.
  - A first port to Win32 was done. Several pieces of not-portable code was
    fixed in the process.
