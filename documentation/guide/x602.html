></H1
><P
>        0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
      program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
      other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
      this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
      Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    </P
><P
>        A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
      prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
      (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
    </P
><P
>        The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
      which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
      Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
      copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
      portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
      straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
      included without limitation in the term "modification".)
    </P
><P
>        "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
      making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
      all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
      interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
      and installation of the library.
    </P
><P
>        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
      covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
      running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
      such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
      on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
      writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
      and what the program that uses the Library does.
    </P
><P
>        1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
      complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
      you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
      appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
      all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
      warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
      Library.
    </P
><P
>        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
      and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
      fee.
    </P
><P
>        2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
      of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
      distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
      above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      <P
></P
><OL
TYPE="a"
><LI
><P
>            The modified work must itself be a software library.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>            You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
            stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>            You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
            charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>            If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
            table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
            the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
            is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
            in the event an application does not supply such function or
            table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
            its purpose remains meaningful.
          </P
><P
>            (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
            a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
            application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
            application-supplied function or table used by this function must
            be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
            root function must still compute square roots.)
          </P
></LI
></OL
>
    </P
><P
>      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
      and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
      themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
      sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
      on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
      this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
      entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
      it.
    </P
><P
>      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
      your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
      exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
      collective works based on the Library.
    </P
><P
>      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
      with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
      a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
      the scope of this License.
    </P
><P
>        3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
      License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
      this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
      that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
      instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
      ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
      that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
      these notices.
    </P
><P
>        Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
      that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
      subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
    </P
><P
>        This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
      the Library into a program that is not a library.
    </P
><P
>        4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
      derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
      under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
      it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
      must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
      medium customarily used for software interchange.
    </P
><P
>        If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
      from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
      source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
      distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
      compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    </P
><P
>        5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
      Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
      linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
      work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
      therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
    </P
><P
>        However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
      creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
      contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
      library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
      Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
    </P
><P
>        When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
      that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
      derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
      Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
      linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
      threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
    </P
><P
>        If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
      structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
      functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
      file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
      work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
      Library will still fall under Section 6.)
    </P
><P
>        Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
      distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
      Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
      whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
    </P
><P
>        6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
      link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
      work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
      under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
      modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
      engineering for debugging such modifications.
    </P
><P
>        You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
      this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
      during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
      copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
      directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
      of these things:

      <P
></P
><OL
TYPE="a"
><LI
><P
>            Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
            machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
            changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
            Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
            with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
            uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
            user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
            executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
            that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
            Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
            to use the modified definitions.)
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>            Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
            Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
            copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
            rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
            will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
            the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
            interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>            Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
            least three years, to give the same user the materials
            specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
            than the cost of performing this distribution.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>            If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
            from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
            specified materials from the same place.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>            Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
            materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
          </P
></LI
></OL
>
    </P
><P
>        For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
      Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
      reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
      the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
      normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
      components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
      which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
      the executable.
    </P
><P
>        It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
      restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
      accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
      use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
      distribute.
    </P
><P
>        7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
      Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
      facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
      library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
      the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
      permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

      <P
></P
><OL
TYPE="a"
><LI
><P
>            Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
            based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
            facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
            Sections above.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>            Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
            that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
            where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
          </P
></LI
></OL
>
    </P
><P
>        8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
      the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
      attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
      distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
      rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
      or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
      terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    </P
><P
>        9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
      signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
      distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
      prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
      modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
      Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
      all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
      the Library or works based on it.
    </P
><P
>        10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
      Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
      original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
      subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
      restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
      You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
      this License.
    </P
><P
>        11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
      infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
      conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
      otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
      excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
      distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
      License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
      may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
      license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
      all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
      the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
      refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
    </P
><P
>      If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
      particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
      and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    </P
><P
>      It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
      patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
      such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
      integrity of the free software distribution system which is
      implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
      generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
      through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
      system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
      to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
      impose that choice.
    </P
><P
>      This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
      be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    </P
><P
>        12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
      certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
      original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
      an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
      so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
      excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
      written in the body of this License.
    </P
><P
>        13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
      versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
      Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
      but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
    </P
><P
>      Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
      specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
      "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
      conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
      the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
      license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
      the Free Software Foundation.
    </P
><P
>        14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
      programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
      write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
      copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
      Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
      decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
      of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
      and reuse of software generally.
    </P
><P
>      NO WARRANTY
    </P
><P
>        15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
      WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
      EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
      OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
      KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
      IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
      LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
      THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    </P
><P
>        16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
      WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
      AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
      FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
      LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
      RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
      FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
      SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
      DAMAGES.
