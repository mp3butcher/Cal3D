    Cal3D. It does not contain any crucial facts you have to know in order to use

      client was to be built for it (see

      information about this system for massively multiplayer online roleplaying
      games). One of the needed components was a character animation system. Looking
      at the existing solutions available under a free license, it was obvious that
      most of them were based on one of the many popular first-person shooter games,
      and therefore quite limited in terms of flexibility and functionality. The
      decision was made that none of them actually fits the desired requirements. Thus
      Cal3D was born, most probably the first library specialized on character
      animation released under a <A
