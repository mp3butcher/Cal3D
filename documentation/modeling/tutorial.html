       <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">  The joy of creating a
virtual    character or creature is that the possibilities are limitless
on what they    can do. The exciting thing is that as computers get faster,
the more it  is  possible to create and bring to life virtual worlds, full
of interacting   people and creatures. As animators, it is our job to animate,
or breathe  life into 3D models.<br>
       <br>
         This tutorial assumes that you have a <font color="#3333ff">low-polygon
  model ready for animation</font>.   It also assumes that you have a basic
  knowledge of <font color="#3333ff">terminology in computer   graphics</font>,
 and a <font color="#3333ff">good knowledge of 3D Studio Max</font>. For
this  tutorial,  I'm  using Max 5.1 with Character Studio 4.0. <br>
    <font color="#cc0000"><br>
    </font><font color="#cc0000">If you are a novice MAX user, I'd  suggest 
 the tutorials that come with MAX, as they are very well written and  will 
 give you a basic knowledge of this wonderful program.</font><br>
       <br>
        First, we've got to go over some basics of what actually goes on
when   animating  a character. By knowing these basics, you can then use
this tutorial   to fit  your own needs. <br>
       <br>
         For those of you not familiar with Character Studio at all, it is
 a  plug-in   that ships with 3DS Max, which makes the process of rigging
a character  much  easier. What's rigging a character you ask? A character
is your mesh  or model that needs to be animated, and before it can be animated,
 we need  to create a system of hierarchies that act as a skeleton. It is
this skeleton   that we actually animate.<br>
       <br>
         Like in our own bodies, our virtual characters get bones as well,
 and   not  only do these bones act as a controlling structure, but also
can  control   deformations such as muscle bulge, etc. Character Studio takes
Max's already   great bones system, and simplifies it, making it much faster
and easier to  rig a character. It is possible, and sometimes necessary to
combine the Character  Studio Biped and Max's traditional bones, i.e. a third
leg or arm, or perhaps  a bunch of tentacles, etc.<br>
       <br>
         This brings me to the basics of Character Studio. Character Studio 
 consists   of 2 programs within the package: Biped &amp; Physique. Biped 
is the skeleton   structure that will control your character. Physique is 
the modifier you  give your character that links it to Biped, thus allowing 
Biped to have complete   control of your character.</font>       <br>

      </big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
         All right, now we can finally start setting up our mesh! Load your 
 model   into Max: it's time to get started! Okay, I've got my Max with 4 
views, which  is the default mode: Top, Front, Right and Perspective in the 
lower right  corner. Make sure your model is in the center of the workspace, 
which is 0 for the X and Y axes, and the feet should be at 0 for the Z axis. 
This way, when we export to Cal3D, it will be properly aligned with the coordinate
  axes (see figure 1).<br>

         The character I'll be rigging today is Jason (see figure 2), who 
is  one  of the kids in  an animation I'm currently working on. Because we 
don't  need  to edit Jason  just yet, we'll select all the pieces that make 
up Jason's   arms, head, legs,  feet and shirt.<br>

     <br>
     Once you have your entire model selected, first hit <font
 color="#3333ff"><i><b>Alt-X</b></i></font>, which turns him  semi-transparent.
  After he's transparent, right-click on or around him and  freeze him</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> (see figure 3)</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">. We'll thaw him out soon enough. We
  freeze him so we don't accidentally click on him while we're setting up
the  Biped. <br>

      <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
        Now, click on the <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Create</b></i></font> 
 tab, and go to the <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Systems</b></i></font> button.
  Click on the   <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Biped</b></i></font> button
(see   figure 4). In the front viewport, click and drag from the bottom of
the  feet to the top of the Biped's head. Click on the <font
 color="#3333ff"><b><i>Motion</i></b></font>   tab, and then select any one
of his appendages. Under the  <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Motion</b></i></font>
tab, you'll get a whole gamut   of settings and options will appear.  Click
on the little icon that resembles   a stick figure. This will put us in Figure
Mode, which allows us to configure   the Biped to conform to our character.
Figure Mode is used for rigging our   character, as well as change settings
without affecting animation.<br>
      <br>

      <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">   &nbsp;<br>
         Moving right along, you'll see under the initial icons, Track Selection,
    Copy/Paste, and Structure. If it isn't already visible, click on the
<font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Structure</b></i></font>   rollout. Because Jason
isn't a super complex character, many of the Biped's settings can remain
the same, but here is how I have set him up for  Jason (see figure 5). Just
a few things have changed from the default, like number of fingers,  links,
etc. As you can see, you can give your model a ponytail, braids, props, 
more leg or spine links, and even have forearm  twist, with as many as 10
links! This provides much more realism when rotating  the wrist, but for
today we'll leave that option unchecked.<br>
       <br>

      <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
         Now that we've explored the Structure rollout, we need to make the 
 Biped   conform to the physiological standards of Jason. In the front viewport,
  click  on the triangle-looking thing located at the Biped's pelvis (see
figure  6). This is the <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Center of Mass</b></i></font>,
  which acts as the base point for all of the Biped. Select the <font
 color="#3333ff"><i><b>Center of Mass</b></i></font> and position it right
  at the crotch area of your model (as in figure 7).<br>
       <br>

      <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
         Next, select the right arm &amp; hand, clavicle, and the left leg
 &amp;    foot. Right click and hide these appendages. Now select the Pelvis
 object    and click on the <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Non-Uniform Scale</b></i></font>
  icon - </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><img
 src="image015.jpg" alt="" width="32" height="39">
    .</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> This is the icon next
    to the Move icon. If the Uniform Scale button is visible, notice the
little     arrow at the lower right indicating more tools, so press &amp;
hold with    the left mouse button for a couple of seconds, and you'll get
to choose  from  available scaling tools. <br>
     <br>
     Use this to scale the pelvis so that the left leg is roughly in the
middle   of Jason's left leg. Then start working your way down his left leg
by scaling   length &amp; relative shape. Keep in mind that Character Studio
4's new Biped  object is much more skeletal shaped than in previous versions,
thus thick bones are not needed. As you are scaling, make sure to line the
knees up, and move the feet into position.<br>
         &nbsp;<br>
         The spine needs to be a bit bigger as well. Starting with the base 
 of  the  spine, scale it just a bit, and then go on to the next link, on 
up to  the  neck. They should be about the same size, and put the shoulders
  and neck in the correct position.</font><br>
         
<div align="center"><br>
         
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">    The Biped's 
  head needs to be a bit bigger. Using our <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Non-Uniform
  Scaling </b></i></font> tool, we scale it to be about the size of Jason's
  head. You may have to also  scale the spine a bit as well. Last but not
least,  scale the arms, hand, and fingers to match our model. When finished,
the left side of your character's Biped object should be closely matched
with its mesh, as in figure 8 below.</font><br>
     </div>
     <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">    </font><br>

     </div>
     <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
         Once you've gotten the left side all set up, its time to get the 
rest   of  the Biped in order. A very nice thing about Character Studio 4 
is the   <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Copy/Paste</b></i></font>  rollout. Drag
your  mouse and select the whole Biped that's visible. Then, click on the
<font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Copy/Paste</b></i> <font color="#000000">rollout 
and under that, the</font> <i><b>Posture</b></i></font> button. Click  on 
<font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Copy Posture</b></i></font>. Now, unhide the rest
of the Biped, and hit <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Paste Posture  Opposite</b></i></font>.
 This will take all of our changes that we made to the left side,  and bring
 them to the right side,  thus making the Biped symmetrical. If you  are
satisfied  with your Biped,  it is a very good idea at this point to click
 on the diskette  icon, which  will allow us to save our Biped figure and
all  of our presets.  Many times  I will start animating and forget to turn
off Figure Mode, thus  losing my  neutral pose. <br>

     <i><b>    Applying the Physique modifier</b></i><br>
       <br>
     </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Now it's time to assign 
  the <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Physique</b></i></font> modifier.</font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">&nbsp;     In a viewport, right-click
 and hit <font color="#3333ff"><b><i>Unfreeze All</i></b></font>. Now that
 Jason is all  thawed  out, click on his feet. For Jason's character, because
 he has many  parts (i.e. the legs are separate from arms) we will give each
 part a Physique   modifier. Click on the <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Modifier</b></i></font>
 tab, and it will be under the modifier list.   You can add it to a custom
 button by clicking on the little button icon in  the upper right corner
of  the Modifier rollout (see figure 10). <br>
     <br>

     </div>
     <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">  <br>
        Select each part of your model and give each part a physique modifier.
   After assigning Physique, click on the <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Link
 to Root Node</b></i></font> button <img src="image022.jpg" alt=""
 width="30" height="30">
     , and then clicking on the <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Center of Mass</b></i></font>
 for the Biped. When you do this,  a window will appear which allows you
to  preset how Physique sets up its influences. For this tutorial, we'll
just  leave it as default. It really doesn't matter what order  you apply
physique,  but if you have many, many parts to a model it's good to do it
in some sort  of order, so you remember which piece does and does not have
the physique  modifier.<br>
         &nbsp;<br>
         Now that they all have Physique applied, if you have multiple meshes 
  in  your character, like Jason does, click on the legs mesh. You will notice 
   that it has many sub-objects similar to your editable mesh or poly that 
 you're  working with. Of all the sub-objects available, we will only be focusing
  on the envelope and vertex sub-objects. The envelope sub-object allows
for   editing of envelopes, which determine which bone affects which vertices.
 When you click on the <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Envelope</b></i></font>
 sub-object, you'll notice lines drawn through your mesh, corresponding to
 the Biped. These are called Links. If you select a link, you'll notice a
balloon-shaped thing that surrounds the link. You'll   also notice the vertices
that it encompasses or is near to are shaded. These   are the vertices that
will be influenced by that link, and in turn, that  particular bone. You
can have multiple bones affect a single vertex, and sometimes you want that,
and sometimes it can be a pain in the ass. <br>
         &nbsp;<br>
         Okay, now go to the <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Vertex Sub-Object</b></i></font>
 mode. You'll see three colored  crosses.  The <font color="#cc0000"><b>Red</b></font>
 indicates deformable vertices, the <b><font color="#33cc00">Green</font></b>
 are rigid vertices, and the  <font color="#3333ff"><b>Blue</b></font> indicates
  that they aren't influenced at all by a bone, or are root vertices.<br>
         &nbsp;<br>
         Next, get out of sub-object mode and click the Biped's left foot 
and   go  to your <font color="#3333ff"><b><i>Motion</i></b></font> tab. Unclick
the <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Figure Mode</b></i></font> button and move
the Biped's  foot  to <b>his</b> left. You'll notice that some vertices from
the right  leg might be dragged along and some from the left leg might be
left behind  (see figure 11). Now click on the <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Key
 Info</b></i></font> rollout and click <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Create
Key</b></i></font>. This will create a key at frame 0 so we can see what
vertex weights need to be edited.<br>
     <br>
     </font>

     </div>
     <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">    &nbsp;<br>
         Going back to Physique, first go into <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Envelopes</b></i></font>
 sub-object mode and  click   on the L Thigh link, bringing up its envelope.
 Looks like it needs  to be  a bit bigger. Using the <font
 color="#3333ff"><i><b>Radial Scale</b></i></font> spinner, increase the
envelopes  overall   scale and watch as the rest of our leg is influenced.
The problem  that we   have now is that parts of the other leg are influenced
by this larger envelope.   Don't worry about that for now and work your way
down the leg, increasing   or decreasing the envelopes to encompass your
mesh. Once you have the left   leg envelopes done, do the same to the right
leg (<b>his</b> right, not yours). Now, if the bones were placed properly
and the envelopes aren't too big or too small, your envelopes won't influence
 the wrong leg. If your envelopes  DO influence the wrong leg, after you've
 sized each envelope, go into the  Vertex sub-object mode. Make sure the
select  button is pressed, and select  the problem vertices. If they are
from the  left leg, and are influenced by  the right leg, click on <font
 color="#3333ff"><b><i>Remove from Link</i></b></font> and select the right 
 thigh and calf  links. This will remove those links from influencing those 
 vertices. <br>
         <br>

     <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
         Now we repeat this process to locate other naughty vertices.<br>
         &nbsp;<br>
         Okay, the head is a bit different, as you don't want it to deform
 as  you  move the head, so select all the vertices above the neck and remove 
 the neck  links influence from them first. Next, we want to assign a Rigid 
 influence  on them to the Head link so click on <font color="#3333ff"><b><i>Assign
 to Link</i></b></font>. Now, remember the three  colored cross buttons?
Right  now, the <font color="#ff0000"><b>red</b></font> should be depressed.
Depress  the <font color="#33cc00"><b>green</b></font> instead, which means
that any  link we then select, it assigns a rigid  influence over, so it
doesn't deform.  This is very useful if you have a robot  with hard metal
or armor on a character  that you dont want stretching or deforming.<br>
         &nbsp;<br>
         Now repeat this process if there are other rigid objects in your 
character.    <br>
         &nbsp;<br>
         After you've edited all the vertex link assignments, it is a good
 idea   to <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Lock</b></i></font> the assignments,
 and if further editing is required, once the vertices    are locked, you
can type in their weights for precise control. This can  be helpful around
the underarm and anywhere else that just seems to be influenced   improperly.
 Keep in mind that you can't change link assignments unless the   selected
 vertices are Unlocked.<br>
       <br>
       Rigging can be the longest and worst part of character animation,
and   you'll   be glad once it's over. The biggest thing to remember is to
do it  right the  first time, and take the time to rig your character well,
otherwise  animating  him can give you much more grief.&nbsp; </font>

       <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">  Finally done with rigging! 
  Now  let's create a simple walking animation.<br>
     <br>

     <small><b>Figure 13 : Walking animation keyframes</b></small></font><br>
     </div>
     <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">  <br>
       To begin, click on a part of the Biped again and go into the <font
 color="#3333ff"><b><i>Motion</i></b></font> tab.   What we'll be making
is a simple walk cycle, and we won't be using Character   Studio's popular
Footstep mode either. <br>
       <br>
       <b><i>Some Basics of Animation</i></b><br>
       <br>
         Traditional cell animation is usually accomplished by artists drawing
   the keyframes first, and then later filling in with the in-betweens. For
   example,  on frame 1, a character is standing, then on frame 8, he's in
 the  air, and  by frame 20 he's on the side of a building. These would be
 the keyframes,  and the poses that make up his actions between these frames
 would be, yes  you got it, the in-betweens. The way you work in Max is a
bit different,  but very similar. First, put your initial poses and keyframe
in the large  poses until you've got your animation. Then come back in and
tweak the poses  in-between each frame so that your character acts and behaves
smoothly. <br>
       <br>
         For our walk cycle, make sure you have your character physiqued, 
then   if  you want you can hide your mesh and just work with the bones. This
helps   if your computer isn't fast or you have many polygons or large textures.
 Sometimes  I like to keep the mesh visible so I can see how it reacts to
certain poses.<br>
       <br>
         Now to start animating Jason. Click on the <font
 color="#3333ff"><b><i>Time  Configuration</i></b></font> dialog  box  (see
figure 14) and make the starting  frame 1 and the ending frame 32.  This
is an even number,  which makes it  easy for keyframing. I set the first
 keyframe to 1 because  we want the animation to loop evenly, which it must
 be one keyframe less,  so it sets back up for the first one in the sequence.

         Here's where observation of people and their movements is critical.
  If  you look at someone walk, you'll notice that not just their legs and
 arms  move, but the spine, hips, and shoulders as well, even if the walk
is basic,   like the one we're making.<br>
       <br>
         Select the pelvis. Since his right leg is the one taking the step, 
 all   the weight will be placed upon the right foot, so in the front viewport, 
  rotate the pelvis just a tad so the right foot is lower than the left (see 
  figure 16).<br>

     <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
         The spine also moves to compensate for weight distribution. Click
 on  the  Spine bone, and while holding CTRL, select Spine 1, Spine 2, and
 Spine  3.  Rotate these in the opposite direction of the pelvis, so they
curve just  slightly to the left of the character (as in figure 17).<br>

         Now, you'll also notice when someone walks, the pelvis, spine and
 shoulders    also rotate just a bit around the Z-axis, i.e. when the left
 arm is forward,    they are rotated from left to right. Don't overdo this
 rotation.<br>
       <br>
         Simple practice and observation of people walking and their movements
   will allow you to make better, more realistic movements.<br>
       <br>
        In the <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Motion</b></i></font> tab, still
 with part of the Biped selected, add a keyframe    under the <font
 color="#3333ff"><i><b>Key Info</b></i></font> rollout. Still in the <font
 color="#3333ff"><i><b>Motion</b></i></font> tab, go to the <font
 color="#3333ff"><b><i>Copy/Paste</i></b></font>    rollout and this time
 click the <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Pose</b></i></font> button and copy
 your pose. Now, drag   the timeslider to frame 32. Click <font
 color="#3333ff"><i><b>Paste Pose</b></i></font>, and add another keyframe. 
 Next,  go to frame 16 and <font color="#3333ff"><i><b>Paste Pose Opposite</b></i></font>.
 If you decide to play this animation,  you'll see your character sliding
along the ground, as if he's on ice. <br>
       <br>
         Now go to frame 8, which is half-way between the first frame and 
frame    16, where we'll put our in-between keyframe. Since he's taking a 
step, we'll   just move his foot up just a tad, but not too much. Usually 
people don't  bend their knees too much when walking casually. Don't forget 
to assign a  keyframe at frame 8. Still on frame 8, copy our pose and go to
frame 24 and  <font color="#3333ff"><b><i>Paste Pose Opposite</i></b></font>. 
Now we have a character that is starting to look like  he's walking!<br>

         &nbsp;<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
         One of the most important parts of Cal3D is the MAX plug-in that 
allows    artists to export their animated characters to a format that the 
programmers    can use. Using the exporter correctly requires a lot of attention 
to detail,    so listen up!<br>
       <br>
         Before we export our model, we need to make our textures according 
 to  what  Cal3D likes. Each material on your character MUST have a slot in
 the  material  editor, and these materials must be named properly with a
number  or Tag starting  with 0. Example:<br>
         &nbsp;<br>
         Pants [0]<br>
         Shirt [1]<br>
         Face [2]<br>
         Arms [3]<br>
         Shoes [4]<br>
       <br>
        Now we are ready to export the model using Cal3D's exporters. The 
latest    exporters can be found at <a
 href="http://gna.org/projects/cal3d/">http://gna.org/projects/cal3d/</a>. 
   It is important to export the SKELETON FIRST. Make sure that the Biped 
is   in FIGURE MODE, and select his Center of Mass. Under the file menu, click
  Export. Now select the Cal3D skeleton exporter, and type a name for your
 skeleton. A dialog box will appear with all of the bones in your Biped checked.
 Just hit next and finish, and you've got your Cal3D skeleton!<br>
       <br>
         After the skeleton is exported, you can export your materials, meshes
   and  animations in any order you want. When exporting your mesh objects
 or  your  animation, the dialog box will ask you for a skeleton, which if
 you  hit browse,  you'll see the skeleton file you just created. When exporting
   the animation file, make sure your Biped is NOT in figure mode. You will
  then be given the choice of FPS and the selection of keys to export. Also,
  if you change your material at all, you have to re-export it AND the mesh
  again, as that tag is saved in both the mesh and the material's Cal3D file.<br>
       <br>
         A bit about Cal3D's Spring system. When exporting your mesh, you 
are   given  the option to enable the cloth spring system. Before you do this,
 make sure  your mesh is set up properly, or MAX will crash. First, make
sure  every polygon  in the mesh has the same smoothing group. I've also
heard that there can only be one material applied to the mesh. Now assign 
a weight to the vertices,  with 0.0 being your rigid vertices, and anything 
greater than 0.0 will give  those vertices a cloth-like property, with the 
higher number being more springy.  Now just export the mesh and enable the 
spring system check.<br>
       <br>
         After everything is exported, create a .cfg file that contains all 
 the   information about the files that make up your character. This can be
 created   using any text editor. When writing the list of included materials, 
 it MUST   be done so that the material tagged with [0] appears FIRST in the
 list, with  the second being [1], etc. I've found it's easier just to name
 my exported   materials with tags as well, so I know in what order to place
 them. <br>
       <br>
         Knowing all this about exporting, here is a sample .cfg:</font>

         On the Cal3D website, you can download a mini-viewer that is used
 to  view  and test your models. All you have to do is drag your .cfg file
 over  Cal3d_miniviewer.exe  and it will run your model. You can also run
it manually  on the command line by typing in Cal3d_miniviewer.exe whatever.cfg,
 with the name of your cfg file replacing whatever.cfg.<br>

         I've taken you through the steps of rigging a character, animating 
 him,   and then exporting him, and now it's your turn to start creating characters
   and giving them life. Have fun with it, and always observe people and
their    movements! Also, in movies, it can be fun to &nbsp;slow down the
motion,   and visually take note where the weight distribution is and the
timing of   everything. This can be really fun during action sequences, such
as the many  in The Matrix, or Lord of the Rings. </font>  <br>
