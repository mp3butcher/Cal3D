>      The Cal3D library stores every motion such as walking, jumping, waving etc. in
      a separate core animation inside the core model. These animations contain one core
      track for each bone that is affected by the specific motion.

>Example 4-2. The waving Walker</B
></P
><P
>        Say we have a walking, human-like model waving with his right hand. There are 2
        animations in this scenario, the one for walking and the other for waving. The
        walking animation does most likely contain a track for every bone there is to
        have a fully animated model. The waving animation will only be defined locally,
        so only tracks for the right hand, arm, shoulder and probably neck and head are
        stored within. This selective inclusion allows a powerful blending and overlay
        mechanism as we will see in <A
HREF="x346.html"

>.
      </P
></DIV
><P
>      The actual transformation data for a bone is stored in several core keyframes
      that are contained in the corresponding track. Each keyframe holds a relative
      rotation and a relative translation to the parent bone for a specified point of
      time. These values are interpolated between two following keyframes by the
      Cal3D library to achieve a smooth motion.
    </P
><P
>      All the above data can be shared between different model instances and is
      therefore completely stored in the Core Classes. The active set of animations
      and their blending state is what makes the difference here, so these values are
      defined in each model instance separately.
