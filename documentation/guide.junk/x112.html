>      Dreaming about the future features is one of the cool things to do when you
      start a new project: The usual sentence you get to hear is something along: "It
      will be better than anything you have ever seen before in every aspect you can
      think of". It should be evident that you are very unlikely to come up with
      something just like that. However, to make the Cal3D project a worthy challenge,
      the goals were still set very high. Even though, they should be seen more as a
      primary basis for design decisions than an ultimate target that needs to be
      reached by 100%. Should it happen, even better.

><P
>        At the time of the project kick-off, the most promising and flexible technology
        for character animation was the skeletal-based approach. It gives you a lot of
        freedom over the animation process and was therefore chosen as a core feature of
        the Cal3D library. On top of it, there is a powerful control system that
        handles the sequence and blending of the animations. Different types, such as
        cycles, actions or poses, will be supported, and it should be easy to add new
        ones to this system. A flexible handling of materials and meshes should make it
        possible to completely change the look of a model. Attachment of other objects
        and models is another 'must have'. Advanced features, such as level-of-detail,
        inverse kinematics, collision-detection and physics will either be outsourced to
        external libraries or will become part of the Cal3D library in the long-term.

><P
>        In spite of the large functionality planned for the library, its usage should be
        simple, logical and intuitive. Unwanted advanced features do not have to be
        taken care of by the user, so basically, there must be a default handling for
        all of them. However, this behaviour should easily be modified or extended
        if needed.

><P
>        It does not make sense to develop a platform-dependent library for an
        application that has to be portable. Hardcoded dependencies on libraries and on
        APIs, such as OpenGL or DirectX, must be avoided. Therefore the library is
        coded in C++ and only depends on the STL. It does not handle the actual
        rendering and the texture-management itself. Necessary platform-dependent code
        (such as endianness) must be minimized and encapsulated into a single class to
        make it easy to add support for other platforms.

><P
>        All aspects of the library must be as scalable as possible. To avoid hardcoded
        limits, the library makes heavy usage of the STL containers to store data.
        Common data of different model instances are shared through the mechanism of
        a core model. Support of a broad range of system configurations, in terms of cpu
        power and other such properties, is provided by implementing level-of-detail
        technologies for models and animations. Thread safety should also be considered
        in the long-term.

>2.2.5. Flexibility</A
></H2
><P
>        Focussing on a single use for the library would prevent its flexibility. So the
        library is developed as a stand-alone component and is not tied up
        with a specific application. Unnecessary constraints and an obscure black-box
        design is a big 'no-no'. Furthermore, all specifications (such as the
        file-formats) are open and freely available. A good documentation goes
        without saying.

>2.2.6. Performance</A
></H2
><P
>        The overall performance of the library is very important. As previously
        mentioned, it will be part of a MMORPG client and should therefore be able to
        handle numerous models at the same time. Besides optimizing the computations
        inside the library itself, the data exchange across the interface has to be
        designed as efficient as possible. Current graphic APIs make heavy use of vertex
        buffers, so this is the choice for the output data. Because render state
        changes strongly affect render performance, the ouput is grouped and
        sorted to minimize those. Caution should be taken that the optimizations do not
        break the clean design of the library.

></H2
><P
>        The library is only useful and used if sufficient and suited tools and
        exporters exist that can produce Cal3D data files. A portable and
        application-independent exporter framework helps in developing exporters for
        the various 3d modelling packages. As some tools may not be able to use the
        framework, an intermediate file-format in XML should be available too.
